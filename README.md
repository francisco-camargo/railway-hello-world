# Railway Hello World

In this repo I aim to deploy the simplest application possible unto a [Railway](https://railway.com/) instance.

## NeuralNine Solution

[This](https://youtu.be/2YmdkXo7iP8?si=5QKCXdAv6RJD32i-) guide by NeuralNine uses the Railway CLI via `npm`

## Railway CLI

[Docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli) for using the Railway CLI.

### Prompt

Help me set up a "Hello, World" project for Railway. Use a Railway Empty Service. I want to run "Hello, World" via Python. I want the code to be in a GitHub repo. I want to develop the code on my laptop. I have Python installed in my laptop. If something besides Python is needed to develop the code and connect to Railway, then I want to use a Docker container on my laptop. If needed use FastAPI, do not use Flask or Django.

### Response

Below is a compact, FastAPI‑only recipe that satisfies every requirement you listed:

---

### 1. Local scaffold

```text
railway-hello-python/
├─ main.py
├─ requirements.txt
└─ railway.toml
```

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Start the FastAPI server

  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

  Your app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

#### railway.toml

```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

`startCommand` is the same setting you’d otherwise type in the dashboard, but committed to code via *Config‑as‑Code* so every deploy is deterministic.

### 2. Deploy on Railway (no local Node or Railway CLI required)

1. **In the Railway UI** click **+ New → Empty Service** and name it `hello-python`.
2. In that service’s **Settings → Source**, connect the GitHub repo you just pushed.
3. Click **Deploy**.
   * Nixpacks detects `requirements.txt`, installs Python & packages, and runs the `startCommand`.
4. When the build goes green, open the autogenerated URL—you’ll see **Hello, World!

### 3. (Optional) Railway CLI in a Docker sandbox

Railway’s CLI is handy for tailing logs or running `railway up`, but it pulls Node/npm. If you want to keep your laptop pure‑Python, wrap it in Docker:

1. Create a **project token** in *Railway → Account → Tokens*.
2. Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e RAILWAY_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> \
  -v ~/.railway:/root/.railway \        # persist credentials
  -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace \
  ghcr.io/railwayapp/cli:latest bash
```

Inside the container:

```bash
railway link            # select the project & service
railway logs -f         # stream logs
# or
railway up              # trigger deploys from local code
```

When you exit, no extra software remains on your host—just your Python env.

---

### Summary

You now have:

* **FastAPI “Hello, World!”** running on Railway’s free tier.
* **Source‑controlled config** that travels with the code.
* A local dev workflow that needs only Python, plus an optional CLI neatly isolated in Docker.

Here's how to deploy a "Hello, World!" FastAPI application using Docker on Railway:

* Project Setup:
  * Create a project directory.
  * Inside, create `main.py` and `requirements.txt`

* Dockerfile:
  * Create a Dockerfile in the project root:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

* Deploy to Railway:
  * Sign in to Railway.
  * Create a new project and choose "Deploy from GitHub Repo" or use the Railway CLI.
  * Link your repository containing the FastAPI app and Dockerfile.
  * Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile, build the image, and deploy the application.
* Access the Application:
  * Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL to access your application.
  * Open the URL in your browser to see the `{"Hello": "World"}` response.
